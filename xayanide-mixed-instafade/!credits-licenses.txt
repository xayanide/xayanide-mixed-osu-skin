This is the credits and licenses of the following osu! skin(s):
    - xayanide-mixed-{n.n.n}-{n.n}-{x}

osu! skin author(s):
    - xayanide

My lightweight mixed osu! skin for osu! standard.

Some elements were made by me (xayanide).
I do not own some of its elements, but all of that will be cleared up in this document.

This osu! skin is focused for low-end hardware, straightforwardness, intuitiveness, playability and gameplay.
Because of that, it's forced to look minamalistic, low quality, with some elements looking slightly pixelated and doesn't have anything good to look at like arts and anime girls.

What makes this different:
- 5 Variants: classic, classic-nc, instafade, instafade-nc, mapping
- Low overall .osk file size
- No redundant elements. It doesn't have a lot of visually or audibly distracting elements
- Blank transparent images all consume 95 bytes in file size
- Blank sounds all consume 44 bytes in file size
- Contains high-definition (@2x) visual elements.
